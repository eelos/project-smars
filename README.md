# Project S-MARS
Project S-MARS is an home automation system implemented on Arduino microcontroller. The system can be controlled by the Android application or the Google Home device. The project is developed by Mario Di Dio, PhD and Sara Craba. Special thanks to Ben Jirasut and Lynne Freeman.

The project started after a couple of months from when we bought a Etekcity Zap remote control and outlet set for our appartment. It was a cool setup but we were constantly loosing the remotes (tipically under the couch).<br>
We opened up the remote and we understood what needed to be soldered to what and we connected a battery of relays to the remote on one side and to Arduino Yun on the other side. That's how our first prototype was born.

After some more soldering (thanks Ben) and more clean up, we assembled our prototype in a nice clear top box with switches and a single 12V DC power source.

We developed an Android application to switch on and off our outlets from any Android device...

and we developed a custom private Google Home Action to control our outlets through Google Home just asking to our Assistant 'Switch on the light in my living room'!

That's it for now, but we are waiting on some new components to extend our personal home automation system!
